# Exaphys

Exaphys is one of my first projects made fully in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Content on the website is fully in Finnish language, I prepared versions for other languages, but ultimately full translation was too time consuming.

I designed and developed the website and its visual content.

The project needs a lot of polishing, but I'm not actively working on it.
