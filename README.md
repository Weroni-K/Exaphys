# Exaphys Project 👨🏼‍🔬

Exaphys is one of my first projects developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was responsible for creating the website's overall design, including its layout, visual aesthetics, animations and images. The theoretical content was provided by a collaborator, ensuring a comprehensive resource for Finnish students.
